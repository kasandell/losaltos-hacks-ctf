    <h3>France</h3>
    <p>Well kiddos, last week marked the end of my month in France. You shoulda seen it. There were croissants and mimes and well <br>
    basically everything French. I went up the Eiffel tower and saw all the streets, and I went on Napoleon's arch. It was super awesome. <br>
    Then I took a train down to St. Tropez. The train ride was just amazing; the French countryside is so scenic. Anyways, once I got to St. <br>
    Tropez, the most amazing thing happened. I met Lil Dicky. It was all around just an amazing trip.</p>

    <h3>Russia</h3>
    <p>Cold. That's the main thing I have to say about Russia. There wasn't a single minute where I wasn't 90% sure I was going to drop dead <br>
    and die of hypothermia. But the food was amazing. And I got to meet Putin and have dinner with him. Honestly he's just a really misunderstood <br>
    guy. He doesn't want to kill everyone in the US, contrary to popular belief - he just wants to put us all in Siberian labor camps. See, he's not <br>
    so mean is he?</p>
