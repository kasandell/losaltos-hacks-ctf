				    <h2>France</h2>
				    <p>Well kiddos, last week marked the end of my month in France. You shoulda seen it. There were croissants and mimes and 
				    basically everything French. I went up the Eiffel tower and saw all the streets, and I went on Napoleon's arch. It was super awes
				    Then I took a train down to St. Tropez. The train ride was just amazing; the French countryside is so scenic. Anyways, once I got to
				    Tropez, the most amazing thing happened. I met Lil Dicky. It was all around just an amazing trip.</p>
				    <br />

				    <h2>Russia</h2>
				    <p>Cold. That's the main thing I have to say about Russia. There wasn't a single minute where I wasn't 90% sure I was going to drop 
				    and die of hypothermia. But the food was amazing. And I got to meet Putin and have dinner with him. Honestly he's just a really misunders
				    guy. He doesn't want to kill everyone in the US, contrary to popular belief - he just wants to put us all in Siberian labor camps. See, he's
				    so mean is he?</p>
				    <br />
				    <!--CA></!-->
				    <h2>Canada</h2>
				    <p>They are the most peaceful people you'll ever meet. I heard the Olympics was going to be hosted in Canada in 7 years, as I heard in my meeting with Justin Trudeau, the PM of Canada. He's a nice guy too, he told me about some upcoming contracts that he has with some tech companies -- not to mention we watched the inaguration of Donald Trump together... was quite an evening.</p>
				    <br />
				    <!--DE></!-->
				    <h2>Germany</h2>
				    <p>Germany is a beautiful place. Especially during the summer, you can watch the sunset in peace over the hilltops of Neuschwanstein Castle, where I had the luxury of staying two months. I've gotta say, they have pretty bad room service. Considering it's a "castle" and all, I was expecting it to be a more majestic vacation.</p>
				    <br />
				    <!--MX></!-->
				    <h2>Mexico</h2>
				    <p>I got here at the worst time. Just as Trump announced his big "wall" scheme. All the Mexicans were furious, there were riots on the street and there was SO much pollution. I mean, come on, how could you possibly fit 3.5 million cars in 1 freeway throughout 1 day? Not frickin possible, that's what I say. That's Mexico City for you. Never going to that place again.</p>
				    <br />
				    <!--SE></!-->
				    <h2>Sweden</h2>
				    <p>Just another typical European country. I mean, come on guys, have some more variety! At least North America has some spicy news each day, but really? It was pretty boring. The same old museums, same old prime minister meeting... well Stefan was a nice guy but it was such a drag to find all the same stuff going on in every single damn country I go to...</p>
				    <br />
				    <!--IT></!-->
				    <h2>Italy</h2>
				    <p>Okay, forget what I said about Sweden. Italy was AWESOME! They have so many amazing foods, and THAT is what appeals to me. I may not be a skinny guy, but who cares? When I have money, I can buy all the pizza and pasta I want! MAMA MIA!!</p>
				    <br />
				    <!--IL></!-->
				    <h2>Israel</h2>
				    <p>I'm getting too old for this... too much sight seeing and not enough sleeping. I mean, come on, a busy guy like me should have some resting time, too! But no, I have to have meeting after meeting after meeting. It's getting old. I might retire when Trump leaves office, that sounds like a good plan.</p>
